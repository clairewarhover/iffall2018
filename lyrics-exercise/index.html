		<br><h1>EYES</h1>

		<h2>{Billie Eilish}</h2>

		<h3>{Verse}</h3>
		<p>
			I've been watching you for some time
		<br>Can't stop staring at those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		<br>Burning cities and napalm skies
		<br>Fifteen flares inside those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		<br>Your <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		</p>

		<h3>{Chorus}</h3>
		<p>
			No fair
		<br>You really know how to make me cry
		<br>When you give me those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		<br>I'm scared
		<br>I've never fallen from quite this high
		<br>Falling into your <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		<br>Those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		</p>

		<h3>{Verse}</h3>
		<p>
			I've been walking through a world gone blind
		<br>Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
		<br>Careful creature made friends with time
		<br>He left her lonely with a diamond mind
		<br>And those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		</p>

		<h3>{Chorus}</h3>
		<p>
			No fair
		<br>You really know how to make me cry
		<br>When you give me those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		<br>I'm scared
		<br>I've never fallen from quite this high
		<br>Falling into your <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		<br>Those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		</p>

		<h3>{Chorus}</h3>
		<p>
			No fair
		<br>You really know how to make me cry
		<br>When you give me those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		<br>I'm scared
		<br>I've never fallen from quite this high
		<br>Falling into your <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		<br>Those <headline>ocean eyes</headline>
		</p>
