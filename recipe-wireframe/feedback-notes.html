	<p>Add a texture or image in the background and make the boxes with the ingredients translucent so that they look more like they do in the game. Could have one of the ingredients be "selected" the way that it is in the game. Use the word "Inventory"  instead of "Ingredients." Two ingredients per column instead of three so that they're larger. Making the images take up the box more. Add the in-game recipe at the bottom, if there's time.

	<p>Moving the words Monster Cake below the logo. Showing a picture of the video game cake and the real cake. Have the cake image take up the whole column. Find a video game font to use or a font that matches the logo. Maybe group dry and wet ingredients together instead of putting them in the order you use them.</p>
