	<h1>Feedback for Gabi</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>For the second postcard, maybe choose a different photo of his architecture so that you don't have to put a colored box for the text. The photo you choose could be black and white, since the other two are, and it might match better.</li>
		<li>The font you chose has some pretty thin lines, which makes it sort of hard to read on backgrounds that aren't flat. Maybe try choosing one that is thicker, or just use a thicker option of the same font.</li>
		<li>You have the text off to the side so that it doesn't overlap the subject of each picture, but I think it would be okay if it overlapped in some places. Just make sure that when it does overlap it is still legible. You could also try picking images that have more room to add text in the negative space.</li>
		<li>This is just a suggestion, but if you use all black and white photos, you could try using colored text. It would make it more legible and also more interesting, and each postcard could have a different color.</li>
