	<h1>LIFE/DEATH</h1>

	<img class="homepage" src="images/mac kid.jpg">

	<h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
	<p class="early life">Malcolm James McCormick was born on January 19, 1992, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Karen Meyers, a photographer, and Mark McCormick, an architect. His father is Christian, and his mother is Jewish. Miller was raised Jewish, had a Bar Mitzvah, and celebrated the Jewish High Holy Days. Because of his religion, he described himself as "the coolest Jewish rapper", in a rival response to Drake's own claim to be "the best Jew in the Rap game". He was raised in the Point Breeze part of Pittsburgh. Miller attended Winchester Thurston School and Taylor Allderdice High School. He began piano lessons at age 6. In high school, Miller decided to focus on his hip hop career, later noting, "Once I hit 15, I got real serious about it and it changed my life completely ... I used to be into sports, play all the sports, go to all the high school parties. But once I found out hip-hop is almost like a job, that's all I did." Miller, a self-taught musician, played piano, guitar, drums, and bass.</p>
